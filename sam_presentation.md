Hi I'm Sam. My work focused on acquiring the data, filling in missing data, and modeling price.

The Data Robusta team set out to see if we could develop a model for predicting Colombian wholesale coffee prices in 2018 dollars per pound. Our initial hypothesis was that temperature and more volatile precipitation would be strong drivers of coffee price. So does weather predict price? Like any good data scientist will tell you...it depends.

At first we tried several models using price, temperature, precipitation, and production quantities to predict price. We used Prophet, a time-series modeling library developed by Facebook, to create these models. Prophet models create three functions: an overall trend, seasonal trends, and holiday trends. These come together to predict the overall pattern of temporal data. 

Initially, climate data appeared to worsen the predictive power of our models; our best early model predicted only on previous prices and production quantities. We experimented with various transformations of weather data, including date-shifting and weighting them by regional production quantities. While neither of those transformations resulted in better predictions than the models that excluded weather data, the latter did inform a major improvement in later models. Since we only had a regional breakdown of production from 2002 onward, that model appeared to greatly improve our predictions, but we quickly realized this was due to limiting the time period, not the new aggregate weather variables.

After some experimentation with the date cutoff, we settled on 1995. At this point, finally, our model that included weather did significantly out-perform the model solely using quantity and price. This final model missed actual prices by an average of about 30 cents, or 17% of the average price. 

Going forward, we think including factors that represent demand and the cost of business could yield a more accurate model. Including data such as US weather, crude oil prices, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Colombian Peso might account for these missing pieces and result in better predictions.
