#### Causes of price spikes and dips post 1994









##### 1994-09-01 and 1995-03-01 (price spike)

- breakout start: 1994-05-01
- breakout end: 1995-12-01

BLUF: 

- Attempts to fight inflation destroyed agricultural profitability, exports declined and area harvested decreased by more than 10% 
- Coffee production dropped 50% from 1993
- Two years of overly heavy rain leading up to 1994

The economic liberalization actions were
implemented in a framework of reduced financial restrictions that were associated with
money laundering and higher interest rates on the dollar (15% and higher) that induced
a process of gradual and continued revaluation of the peso. The shift in resource
allocation to nontradeables triggered by the revaluation of the peso coincided with lower
international prices for foods and beverages and by two years of rain failures amidst
elimination or sharp reductions of import tariffs, quotas and restraints.

The fight against inflation (which has been around 20% to 25% per year) was focused on
reducing food prices to the urban consumer by increasing food imports sharply from 1.2
million tons in 1990 to about 3.0 million tons in 1993. The policies had a negative impact
on the balance of trade of the country, which was positive by 1990 (with over US$1
billion) to become deficitary at about US$3.0 billion by 1993. In this fight against inflation,
food imports boomed, agricultural profitability was shattered, its exports declined and area
harvested decreased by more than 10% from 4.9 to 4.4 million has. 

Temporary (or cash) crop area fell from 2.5 to 2.1 million has. The area under tree crops
did not decrease much as it is quite inelastic in the short run; however, its productivity declined sharply, particularly in coffee, where production fell by 50% (from 18 million 60
kg. bags in 1993 to 11 million in 1994)

##### 1997-05-01 (price spike)

breakout start: 1997-01-01
breakout end: 1998-06-01

BLUF: 

- Heavy rain reduced supply 20% and threated supply lines
- Brazil production dropped 25%


Coffee futures prices jumped to 16-month highs yesterday as heavy rains in South America delayed Colombian coffee shipments and threatened to reduce what is expected to be a dismal Brazilian crop at a time when supplies are dwindling.

Brazil, the world's leading producer, harvested a relatively small 27 million 132-pound bags last year and has indicated production will be a sharply lower 20 million bags this year.

Now, floods this week in parts of Brazil and Colombia have raised fears of a further tightening of coffee stocks. The rain delays could cause Colombia's production to fall as much as 20 percent from the projected 12.5 million bags, some analysts noted. And Brazilian production could fall below 18 million bags.

##### 2002-08-01 (price dip)

breakout start: 2000-08-01
breakout end: 2005-02-01

BLUF: 

- Spikes in coffee production over 6+ years of strong pricing
- Vietnam coming online as a major producer
- Brazil finally recovering from weather reductions from mid 90s

The economics behind the current drop in coffee prices is as simple as the solution has proven intractable: supply far outstrips demand. For the 2001-2002 crop year, for instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates world coffee production to be almost 116 million 60-kilogram bags, while consumption is estimated to fall short of this figure by around five million bags (about 600 million pounds).


Moreover, the impressive growth of Vietnam’s coffee sector is not the only contributor to the coffee glut. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Brazil has been producing above 30 million bags a year since 1998-1999—up from 28 and 23 million bags in 1996 and 1997, respectively—and the total number of coffee trees in Brazil has been growing steadily since 1998-1999.

Perhaps the clearest culprit in the oversupply of coffee is the coffee tree itself. It takes at least two years (more for some varieties) for new trees to produce sufficient yields to justify the costs of harvesting. This means that production is slow to react to price changes. “High prices encourage new planting, but the new trees do not have any immediate effect on prices, and there is a tendency towards overplanting,” points out Colby College sociologist John M. Talbot in an article in Studies in Comparative International Development.

Today’s bountiful coffee harvest is to a large extent due to a series of severe frosts that affected Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, in 1994 and led to rising prices that continued This encouraged new tree plantings whose harvests are in the market today.

Between 2003 and 2008, speculative investment in commodity
indexes was estimated to have increased from $15 billion to around $200 billion

##### 2011-04-01 and 2011-09-01 (price spike into price dip)

breakout start: 2009-05-01
breakout end: 2012-06-01

BLUF: 
- Stockpile at 50 year low
- 3 years of abnormally wet weather
- Strong, rising demand for coffee
- Coffee rust hit in early 2012 and continued to drive price down

April 2011 - The latest surge in coffee prices comes only days after the International Coffee Organisation, which represents producers and consumers, warned that scarce supplies of arabica beans continued to "support high price levels". The London-based group does not expect that coffee stocks, which are at their lowest level for 50 years, will build up this year.

The price of a cup of coffee is likely to go up further as coffee prices have topped $3 a pound for the first time in more than 34 years. Poor harvests of high-grade arabica coffee beans and a growing taste for gourmet coffee among burgeoning middle classes in China, Brazil, Indonesia and India are behind the sharp rise.

For three years, abnormally wet conditions have caused massive flooding in the county's flatlands and damage to his crops.

In the face of strong demand, coffee inventories have fallen to their lowest levels on record. A decade ago, coffee-making countries had stored some 55.1 million 60-kilogram bags. Last year, stocks fell to 13 million bags.
