*** exploratory discoveries and quantitative analysis

Sam broke down the model and variables we ended up using to predict prices. I would like to talk to you about some of the insights we uncovered exploring the data. The exploration phase was instrumental in helping our team understand what was, and just as important, what wasn't driving price.

Sam mentioned the final model used only post 1995 years. After discovering the newer dates improved the model we explored the shape and distribution of the price over time. It was quickly apparent the prices were bimodal, with two very distinct patterns: pre and post 1995. This split left us with two unique price trends that were very close to normal distribution. This was very helpful in understanding why our model performed so much better with newer dates.

Next we asked ourselves: Does international production volume provide predictive power for Colombia's coffee price?

We compared Colombia's exports to that their geographic neighbor and coffee competitor, Brazil. We were looking for potential leading indicators from Brazil's exports that would move Colombia's exports/price in a predicable manner.

The graph here shows that there was not a strong predictor of Colombia's coffee price or production based on Brazil's coffee activity.

One very interesting insight we found. Was a drastic drop in the size of 




Huila, Antioquia, and Tolima produce about half of Colombia's coffee

 Talk about lack of corr with weather and price. 

 One or two stat facts

 temperatures




 (Graph with overview of price spikes)
1976, 1986 and 1994; all of these years the price of coffee significantly spiked primarily due to weather related conditions. Certainly weather does have an impact on price but its impacts are most prevalent during extreme events; weather macro trends cannot (*preform/cannot be seen as well/cannot be accounted for as well*) during most other times. This is due to the markets natural gravitation towards a lower price due to modernization, innovation, and the perseverance of the farmers themselves. Other major fluctuations can be attributed to events such as (graph of 1995 to 2015) disease, government policy changes, natural disasters.
