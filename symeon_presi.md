I'm going to walk through some of the insights we uncovered exploring data from the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia known as Fedecafe and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. 


This exploration was instrumental in driving our team's understanding of what was, and just as importantly, what wasnâ€™t driving price.

After visualizing some of the data we acquired from NOAA, minimum temperature appeared to correlate with price. However, statistical analysis rejected this assumption.

In the early 90s, Fedecafe worked closely with Colombian farmers, helping them learn better farming techniques. 

This created two different stories, one pre-1995 and one post-1995.

Analyzing this data together is like comparing automobile production before and after Henry Ford invented the assembly line. 

These new technologies and practices resulted in long-term sustainability of family farms which led to a more stable coffee economy.

(Slide: Colombia and Brazil Exports)

Next we asked ourselves: Can changes in other nation's coffee exports predict shifts in the Colombian coffee price?

We acquired additional data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity which provided us with global coffee export data. 

We chose to examine Brazilian exports because Brazil is the largest coffee exporter in the world.

While Brazilian exports generally rise and fall with those of Colombia, our analysis concluded that those movements occur at the same times, so they cannot predict one another.

Now I'm going to hand it over to Sam for modeling.
