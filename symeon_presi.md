I'm going to walk through some of the insights we uncovered exploring the data from the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia known as Fedecafe and the National Oceanaic and Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. 

The exploration phase was instrumental in driving our team's understanding of what was, and just as importantly, what wasnâ€™t driving price.

(Slide: NOAA mean_temp/min_temp and Fedecafe price over time)

After visualizing some of the data we acquired from NOAA, minimum temperature per year appeared to correlate with average annual price. However, statistical analysis determined weather did not drive price.

In the early 90s, Fedecafe worked closely with Colombian farmers, helping them learn more advanced farming techniques. 

In effect, Fedecafe's efforts created a totally different market, evidenced by the distinct price distributions before and after 1995.

These new technologies and practices resulted in long-term sustainability of family farms which led to a more stable coffee economy.

(Slide: Colombia and Brazil Exports)

Next we asked ourselves: Can changes in other nation's coffee exports predict shifts in the Colombian coffee price?

We acquired additional data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity which provided us with global coffee export data. 

We chose to examine Brazilian exports because Brazil is the largest coffee exporter in the world.

While Brazilian exports generally rise and fall with those of Colombia, our analysis determined that those movements occur at the same times, so they cannot predict one another.
