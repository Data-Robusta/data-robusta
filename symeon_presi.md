(Slide: FEDECAFE and NOAA pics)

I'm going walk us though some of the insights we uncovered exploring the data from the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia known as Fedecafe and the National Oceanaic and Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. The exploration phase was instrumental in helping our team understand what was, and just as importantly, what wasnâ€™t driving price.


(Slide: Bimodal Distribution/ two normal dists)
In the early 90s, Fedecafe worked closely with Colombian farmers, helping them learn more advanced farming techniques. Their effect on prices became more evident during exploration where we found prices were bimodal; from this two normal distributions can be created, one for pre-1995 and one for post-1995 data, both with unique trends and volatility. The shift in trends and volatility can be largly attibuted to Fedecafe's involvement to create long-term sustainability of family farms which lead to a more stable coffee economy. 

(Slide: Colombia and Brazil Exports)

Next we asked ourselves: Do international export volumes of coffee provide predictive power for Colombia's coffee price?

We aquired additional data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity; this provided us with coffee export data for Brazilian and Colombian coffee. 

We had chosen to use Brazil as it was the next largest producer of coffee.

We analyzed the Brazilian data for indicators that would ahead of time influence Colombia's exports or price. 

After comparing Colombia's exports to that of Brazil's we determined that there was no early indicators given off by Brazilian export data. 

The graph here shows that there was no early indications given reagarding Colombia's production based on Brazil's prior activity,meaning Brazilian and Colombian production tend to move in concert.
