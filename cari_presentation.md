The data exploration identified extreme price spikes, but it did not tell us what created them. We dove deeper into the data to identify the causes of these disruptions.
Several different types of events can cause coffee volatility. Hard frost, trade agreements, exchange rates, and plant disease can all cause fluctuations from 2-10x of the normal price.

These changes last one to five years because coffee plants take a long time to repopulate and produce fruit.

In 1975, the Brazilian "Black Frost" destroyed 70% of Brazil's coffee plants, causing prices to skyrocket for several years. National Coffee prices are not insulated from other countries' misfortunes. Such disasters can benefit unaffected countries in the short term, but make long term planning difficult for farmers.

2002 emerging markets

In the years leading up to the crash, farmers aggresively expanded their farms. In 2002, Coffee prices plummeted to 39 cents per pound, due to a sharp decrease in global demand. 


Coffee prices remained depressed through 2008, leading Fedecafe to promote diversification in the Colombian economy.

2011 plant disease

Plant disease is yet another concern for Colombian coffee farmers. Coffee Rust destroyed 30% of Colombia's coffee farms from 2008 to 2011, leading to reduced coffee production and widespread food scarcity.

#### End

Coffee is a $200 billion industry and the second most traded commodity worldwide. Given coffee's global economic importance, we decided to focus on the most well-known coffee producting country in the world: Colombia.

Price instability affects real people, and data science can help to predict and prepare for those events. We created models to aid in Fedecafe's long-term crop forecasting and stockpile management.

Real-time natural language processing of Colombian social media, Fedecafe news, and economic news could predict major market disruptions. Data science will help to stabilize the economy for more than half a million coffee farmers in Colombia and those around the world that enjoy their coffee.
