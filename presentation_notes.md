The individual farmer with a small 7 hectare farm

#### Problem

The Colombian coffee farmer is far more greatly affected by price volatility than the average US Starbucks customer.

When coffee farming becomes unprofitable, the small farmer often abandons coffee in favor of illegal crops or migrating to another country to pursue more viable livelihood. This causes further volatility in the market due to lack of consistent coffee production.

#### What idea do you want the audience to adopt?

We want the audience to see that price volatility is a negative

We want them to adopt purchasing habits that support price stablity to empower the single family Colombian farmer, that make up the majority of coffee suppliers for the cup of joe that we enjoy daily.

#### What are the stakes if people adopt our view or reject

If you adopt our view, millions of single family farmers around the world will have a more sustainable livelihood to provide for their families

if the status quo is maintained, price volatility will continue to funnel farmers towards the illicit drug trade.

### Presentation Structure

#### Beginning/Setting the scene

##### Goal: Describe the audience's ordinary world and set the baseline for what it is.

Presentation content: 

Since 1995 Colombia has sold it's coffee to the market around $1.50 to $2 per pound.

In 1997 heavy rain wiped out approximately 25% of Colombia's coffee plants. This caused global coffee prices to skyrocket to 2.5x the normal price. It took over 3 years for prices to return to normal.

#### Middle 

##### Goal:

Clearly contrast what is with what could be so teh audience feels the tension and begins to desire resolution of that tension.

After calling them to the adventure, overcome their resistance, provide them with what they need to succeed, and guide them through the solution - all while contrasting the status quo with the loftiness of the idea

##### Presentation content:

The Data Robusta team set out to see if rising temps and more volatile precipitation affected coffee price.

Several models were tried with various weather and economic features. Ultimately the best model used price over time and production quantity to create the best model


#### End

Goal: Give them a clear call to action and propose a new bliss that lures them toward your idea. Make it clear how the world will be a better place once your idea is adopted.
