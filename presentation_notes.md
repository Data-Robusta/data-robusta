### Presentation

#### Hero

The data science day audience

#### The damsel

The individual farmer with a small 7 hectare farm

#### Problem

The Colombian coffee farmer is far more greatly affected by price volatility than the average US Starbucks customer.

When coffee farming becomes unprofitable, the small farmer often abandons coffee in favor of illegal crops or migrating to another country to pursue more lucrative opportunities

#### What idea do you want the audience to adopt?

We want the audience to see that price volatility is a negative

We want them to adopt purchasing habits that support price stablity to empower the single family Colombian farmer, that make up the majority of coffee suppliers for the cup of joe that we enjoy daily.

#### What are the stakes if people adopt our view or reject

If you adopt our view, millions of single family farmers around the world will have a more sustainable livelihood to provide for their families

if the status quo is maintained, price volatility will continue to funnel farmers towards the illicit drug trade.

#### New Bliss

A more stable South America. 

Audience: Eventually price volatility will impact consumer prices, which means more expensive coffeee for you and me.

Sphere of influence: Use your new founnd knowledge of the single family farmer to inspire your network to purchase fair trade coffee and support single family farms

Benefit to world: Colombia is a mircocosom of Latin American, South American, and the Western Hemisphre as a whole. A more stable single family farmer is a more stable Colombia. A more stable Colombia is a more stable Americas.
