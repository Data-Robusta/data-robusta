### Backstory

#### Hero

The data science day audience

#### The damsel

The individual farmer with a small 7 hectare farm

#### Problem

The Colombian coffee farmer is far more greatly affected by price volatility than the average US Starbucks customer.

When coffee farming becomes unprofitable, the small farmer often abandons coffee in favor of illegal crops or migrating to another country to pursue more viable livelihood. This causes further volatility in the market due to lack of consistent coffee production.

#### What idea do you want the audience to adopt?

We want the audience to see that price volatility is a negative

Volatility in the market will increase prices at your local coffee shop **



#### What are the stakes if people adopt our view or reject

If you adopt our view, millions of single family farmers around the world will have a more sustainable livelihood to provide for their families

if the status quo is maintained, price volatility will continue to funnel farmers towards the illicit drug trade.

#### New Bliss

A more stable South America. 

Audience: Price volatility impact consumer prices over the long term, which means more expensive coffeee for you and me at the grocery store.

Sphere of influence: Use your new founnd knowledge of the single family farmer to inspire your network to purchase fair trade coffee and support single family farms

Benefit to world: Colombia is a mircocosom of Latin American, South American, and the Western Hemisphre as a whole. A more stable single family farmer is a more stable Colombia. A more stable Colombia is a more stable Americas. 


### Presentation Structure

#### Beginning/Setting the scene
Presenter: Jeff
slide: cup of coffee
You have probably paid about the same for a cup of coffee as far back as you can remember. We were curious to see if changing weather patterns would threaten the price of America's motor: Caffeine. 

With that in mind we decided to look at the weather and coffee production of the most well known coffee producting country in the world: Colombia

Coffee grows best in volcanic soil, at altitudes of 1,200 to 1,800 meters, in places without frost, and receiving around 80 inches of rain a year. Colombia ticks all those boxes.

Since 1995 Colombia has sold it's coffee to the market around $1.50 to $2 per pound. BUTTT

slide: flooding in Colombia

In 1997 heavy rain wiped out approximately 25% of Colombia's coffee plants. This caused global coffee prices to skyrocket to 2.5x the normal price. It took over 3 years for prices to return to normal. 70% of Colombia's coffee is produced by single family farmers.

Price spikes like this may cause a slight cost increase in your morning cup of joe, but for these farmers it destroys their livelihood.

Catastrophes like this can create 4x the normal volatility seen in the market

These types of events come in many forms: Weather, economic, plant disease, and political

#### Middle 
Presenter: Sam
The Data Robusta team set out to see if rising temps and more volatile precipitation affected coffee price.

slide: models compared to actual price

At first we tried several models using price, temperature, precipitation, import/export quanities to predict price. But we found that the most relevant variables were price over time and coffee production quantity. Even still the model struggled to produce accurate results. We found that difficult to predict events like plant disease, natural disasters, and major trade agreements incite extreme price movements in the market.

*** Showing our thought process and qualitative analysis

The data exploration identified the extreme price spikes, but it did not tell us what was creating them. We decide to take a deeper dive into the drivers and how they affected prices over time.

What we found was that coffee volatility can be created by several different types of events. Prolonged frost, trade agreements, exchange rates, and plant disease can all cause price spikes 2-10x the normal price. These events have serious long term effects on the price of coffee as well; prices can take 18 months to 5 years to return to normal levels.

In 1975, the now named Brazilian "Black Frost" destroyed 40% of Brazil's coffee plants. This caused prices to skyrocket to worldwide record highs and several years to return to normal. Coffee producing countries are not insulated from other countries' misfortunes affecting their own coffee export prices. Foreign disasters like this can be price beneficial to unaffected countries, but are not sustainable and make long term planning difficult for farmers.

#### End

Goal: Give them a clear call to action and propose a new bliss that lures them toward your idea. Make it clear how the world will be a better place once your idea is adopted.


To sum up the true impact of these staggering stats and stories. Price spikes come from many different directions and can be difficult to predict. Our model was adequate at predicting prices during periods of relative stability, but as a follow on project we believe we can identify early triggers of these types of events. We would like to create a natural language processing model that would examine live streams of local social media posts discussing weather and
